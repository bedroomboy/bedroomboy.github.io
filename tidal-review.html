        <p>Fiona Apple’s debut effort, <span style = "font-family: Poppins SemiBold;">Tidal</span>, is a smooth, yet aggressive album.</p>
        <p>The abundance of the delightful piano work all through the album, together with Apple’s silky, smooth vocal texture and beautiful 
        vocal melodies on tracks like <span style = "font-family: Poppins SemiBold;">Sullen Girl</span>, <span style = "font-family: Poppins 
        SemiBold;">Slow Like Honey</span>, <span style = "font-family: Poppins SemiBold;">Never Is a Promise</span> and <span style = 
        "font-family: Poppins SemiBold;">Pale September</span> creates a light, but melancholic atmosphere. Apple also occasionally evinces her 
        energetic singing on tracks like the intro, <span style = "font-family: Poppins SemiBold;">Sleep to Dream</span>, <span style = 
        "font-family: Poppins SemiBold;">Shadowboxer</span> and <span style = "font-family: Poppins SemiBold;">Criminal</span> which does very 
        well to reinforce her emotions.</p>
        <p>The concept of this album varies as Apple addresses disparate topics like: finding repose in the midst of uncertainties; how she was 
        perceived by people around her due to the tragic incident of her being raped as a child; loss of innocence and more; but majorly about 
        the frivolousness of her partner, her inexorable craving for him and also her disappointment towards him.</p>
        <p>The figurative writing on this album is amazing, as it makes the album open to various interpretations, but what devalues it is the 
        sequencing (particularly the placement of <span style = "font-family: Poppins SemiBold;">Pale September</span> on the tracklist).</p>
        <p>Nonetheless, <span style = "font-family: Poppins SemiBold;">Tidal</span> is a very great breakup album, and I really enjoyed it!</p>
